## ANSWERS
### TIMELESS TREASURES

Repetition of any work over a long period of time will result in developing an expertise in the work. Because, over time many mistakes would have been made which would have resulted in improvisations.  

Tamil civilization is one such old and highly advanced civilization. For eg: Tholkappiam is a very old Tamil scientific work on Tamil Grammar. It is still not clear when it was composed, at the very least it was written nearly 7000 years ago. 
For the speakers of a language to bring out a book on Grammar, the language should have been in atleast the spoken form much before that. Because, grammar is nothing but a set of rules, for its speakers, that has been formulated after observing a language over a long period of time.  

Historical evidence shows that The Tamil Civilization was a fairly developed, even advanced civilization. The Tamils observed life over their years and made recordings in print form as to what works and what doesn't. They experimented with various social & political structures, different life styles and they came to certain conclsions about what style of life will lead to happy people. 
These recordings together make our vast Tamil Literature. 

It is impossible to read and comprehend all of the written work in Tamil in one lifetime. Fortunately, it is regarded among scholars that Thirukkural carries the essence of ALL of Tamil’s Literary works.  

If we look at our lives carefully, we will see that Nature protects and safeguards truth. Whatever is not necessary, Nature removes it overnight. Nature can and has moved mountains, wiped out civilizations, created and destroyed species from the face of the earth. Nature Knows! She is intelligent and powerful.  

In the current age of advanced technology, nearly all of us have are equipped with latest gadgets. Despite the increase in the RAM capacity and Gigabytes of storage available, and tons of photocopies and multiple prints of books, it is ironical that always the ‘one important piece of paper’ always goes missing, just when you need it! It has to be undoubtedly, the power of Nature that has allowed the Thirukkural that was probably composed somewhere around 500 BCE, that too on palm leaves, when gurus probably lived in mud houses with thatched roofs, to be passed on to our generation without much damage. 

If we question as to why Nature chose to preserve certain written documents, the only obvious answer seems to be that there is probably something of value in it – a timeless piece of knowledge that is essential for a happy life on this earth.
What She has destroyed, it should be understood that it is not necessary for our current time period. So if She has chosen to preserve something that is more than 2000 years old, then we should understand that there is some element of truth in it. Maybe it has something that is necessary for life in our current days.

## WHAT IS ARAM
When we stare at the sky on a full moon night, with the moon and the stars above us, we realize that there is some order in nature. There are many planets and  galaxies are around us, but they are all following a certain order.  If suddenly one planet removes itself from the orbit, and spins off course, the entire Universe would collapse. We are sitting here and reading this page in peace only because some order is existing in creation, whether we realize it or not.

A fish has boundaries, that is, it can thrive well in water. A bird has its boundaries and as long as it respects that boundary, it can live beautifully. The same logic goes for a flower or deep sea creatures. A deep sea creature cannot survive in shallow water and a flower dies if it is separated from the plant. As long as creation operates within its specified boundary, there is harmony.
If all these living beings have such an order in nature, what about us, a creature with 6 senses? Do we have such an order? Is it possible to live however we please and still have a peaceful life? It’s something to think about.  

If every other creation around us is able to maintain equilibrium with each other and exist in harmony, then there probably exists some order by which we, who are an equal part of creation, should live our lives, in order to live in harmony with creation. Such an order that applies to our individual lives is called as Aram or Dharmam.  

But why should some take the effort to write a book on Aram? What was the need to tell Aram for everyone? Is it so important? 
No matter how wealthy, intelligent  and clever a person might me, a peaceful and happy life can only be had by those who choose to live in harmoney with nature - that is who walks the path of Aram. There can be no peaceful life for the rest.  

Aram refers to our boundaries. What are the things that we are allowed to do and what are the things we are not allowed, if we want to lead a happy life (vithithana seithal and vilakiyathai ozhithal).

## PRAMANAMS
If humans must make their own mistakes in life and learn from scratch, every single time, then there is no use in our race being blessed with six senses. If fire is hot, then it is enough if one human learns it. Others must be able to benefit from that person’s experience.
Aram refers to the rules of life embedded in Nature. But, how can anyone observe or learn these rules of life from nature? Only some things are obvious. For example, ***one will catch a cold if ones stands for too long in the rain***, is an obvious fact that can be observed by ordinary humans. But some other things such as: **what are the consequences of being ungrateful?*** These are not so obvious. It would be useful if someone who could observe nature, tell us all the Arams applicable to our daily life.  

But, more importantly, how do we trust that person? How can we know, what that person says is true?
Our ancestors believed in accurately measuring things. Whether it was a piece of cloth or a basket of vegetables, things had to be measured. In order to measure something, we need measurement tools.  

They also measured truth, that is, how can we believe that “truth” is actually 100% true? They wrote books that dealt with measurements and these books are called ** “Tharkka noolgal”**. These formed the math portion of Tamil literature. It is also called **Alavai Iyal** (or science of measurement). These books discuss the methods used to determine the truth. (something like, how much truth is there in a sentence that I may speak). A thorough knowledge of this subject was a pre-requisite in studying **Thathuvam** (fundamental principles of creation). Many books on this subject are lost or destroyed and we now have only 1 or 2 with us now. The following are some introductory concepts from Sivagnana Sithiyar’s work.  

Broadly, there are 10 ways of measuring truth. These ways are called Pramanams. They measured truth with Pramanam. The 10 Pramanams were condensed to the following three Pramanams:
1.    Kaatchi Pramanam (Proof of sight)
2.    Anumana Pramanam (Proof by inference)
3.    Agama Pramanam (Proof by the words of the wise)  

**Kaatchi Pramanam** (also called Kandal Alavai in Tamil) is when someone uses their sense organs to identify the truth. Kaatchi  in Tamil means Sight, but Kaatchi Pramanam refers to other sense organs too. Eg: I see a cat and I say ‘there is a cat’, or I hear a girl sing and say ‘she is a good singer’, similarly for other sense organs.
But this is not an accurate system of determining the truth because it depends on (a) the observer’s intelligence  and (b) the time frame of the observed action. For eg: a policeman could see a woman dead on the floor with a knife through her chest. A man is sitting near her holding the knife. It cannot be concluded that the man killed the woman. The time at which the murder happened has already elapsed.
The Kaatchi Pramanam needs more explanation. There are 4 types of Kaatchi (Kaatchi in Tamil means sight).
1.    Vayir Kaatchi (External Sight)
2.    Manutha Kaatchi (The recognized image in the mind)
3.    Thanvedanai Kaatchi (The response experienced by the Soul)
4.    Yoga Kaatchi (The true untarnished vision experienced by our Soul)
To understand these, we need to understand how sense organs work. Just the presence of sense organs alone is not enough to experience the world. We need the mind to process the data sent by the sense organs. We all know that we have 5 sense organs.   

We have a mind that also has 4 parts. They are 
1.	Manam (for analyzing)
2.	Buthi (for confirming),
3.	Ahangaram (to motiviate), 
4.	and Chitam.   

These 4 parts are also called as **Andha Karnangal**. Chitam is the base from which, and on which the other 3 parts of the mind are formed.  

So, the process of seeing (hearing/smelling/touching/tasting) would involve an interaction of the mind with the external organ – let’s take the example of the eye and see the involvement of the mind in the process of “seeing”.  

1. When the eye sees a rose, an image falls on the retina (this image is also called Vayir Kaatchi or Poriyr Kaatchi) and is sent to the Manam (the unrecognized image in our Manam is called **Nirivigarpa Kaatchi**).  
2. The job of Manam is to analyze. The Manam searches, in this case, it analyzes *** ‘is this a rose, or a cat or a chair’***  against the data previously stored in the Buthi.  
3. The Buthi has all data recordings of not only this birth but of all the births that we have ever taken (instincts are stored here like the immediate action of an infant to turn its head to nurse). Buthi confirms that the image is that of a rose (the confirmed image in the buthi is called **Sarvigatpa Kaatchi**) and sends it back to Manam (this recognized image in the Manam is called Manutha kaatchi).  
4. Now the Manam generates a response that is either a happy or a sad one (for instance, when we see our enemy we have negative responses, a rose may generate happy response) and this response is called **Thanvethanai Katchi** and it is felt by our Uyir (or soul).  

And that is how, we experience life. We can forget about the names of all the Kaatchis and grasp only the concept.

We can observe our mind doing all of the above mentioned analyzing and confirming work, when we engage in a slightly difficult task, like listening to music and trying to identif a raga, or when looking at a difficult math problem and thinking of a solution.
When we are multi-tasking, even though we feel like we are doing many things at the same time, the response to the sense organs actually takes place sequentially, in our mind. But because of the speed of the mind, it appears as if we are typing and singing and listening at the same time. The job of Ahangaram is to keep us motivated and prevent us from getting tired doing all this mental work.  

**Anumana Pramanam** (also called Karuthal Alavai in Tamil) is determining the truth by inference. When two objects are closely related, the presence of one means that the other object is also present. For eg: the presence of smoke indicates the presence of fire. If is a person is a thief, there is a good chance that lying can also be found. But, this method is also not 100% accurate.  

At the end of this cognition, who or where does the final experience, positive or negative occur? They say that it is the Uyir also called Anma(soul) which is the only intelligent part of us that experiences the final result. The 4 parts of the mind and 5 sense organs do not possess any inherent intelligence. Just as how when we use spectacles or a telescope to see things, we don’t say that the spectacle or telescope has any intelligence. It is the observer’s Uyir that possesses the intelligence. The Anma uses the sense organs to see or hear or taste etc.  

Anma is trapped inside the body and therefore its experience is limited to how long our eyes can see (or how far our ears can hear etc). So, if the Anma wants to experience seeing the Himalayas it has to drag the body along.  

Our ancestors found this as a great inconvenience. What if they could remove the Anma and allow it to experience the world? A direct experience that would not need any sense organs and body. They researched and succeeded. And that is called the **Yoga Kaatchi**.
That is how our ancestors found out about solar system, the process of evolution, and that the world is not flat, the stages of human embryo development, the colour of Mars (they even named it after the colour red –chevvaai) and everything other scientific discovery.
Such a person who is able to remove his Anma and allow it to integrate with nature, will be able to get a true picture of ‘Truth’. That person is a Yogi, a human renounced of all worldly possessions. When such a person says something, it is called **Agama Pramanam.** Thiruvalluvar,  Paramahamsar , Ramanar, Jesus, Prophet, are all examples of people who had Yoga Kaatchi.  

These Agama Pramanams are not meant to be disputed by regular humans. We do not have the capacity to argue against their words.  If what they say doesn’t make any sense, or goes against our beliefs then it can only mean that we haven’t fully understood it. It does not mean that they have made a mistake or that their words are irrelevant! Thiruvalluvar used his Yoga Kaatchi to observe Aram from nature and gave us Thirukkural. It is agama Pramanam and hence has 100%  truth in it.

## Nameless Masterpiece
The preface or prologue of a book is called as “Payiram” in Tamil. In those days, there wasn’t a library or a digital catalogue to categorize books according to the subject. So the preface naturally became an important part of any book, as it gave an overview about the contents. This allowed a reader to spend her/his time wisely. The reader need not read the entire book to realize that it doesn’t fit with her area of interest.  

There are certain rules to write a preface for any book. As per Nanool and Tholkappiyam (ancient books on Tamil Grammar) a preface should contain, at the least (a) the name of the author (b) the place or the conference where the book made its debut (c) the name of the chairperson under whose leadership the book made its debut, and so on. There were also criteria to decide who was qualified to write the preface. Almost all books in Tamil literature have a Payiram in accordance to these criteria.
Thirukkural also contains a section on Payiram with 4 topics but none of them contain the required elements of the Payiram. Thiruvalluvar breaks all the rules. Interestingly, he does not even put down his name as the author of the book.

Will I (or you) ever write a book that will stand good for thousands of years and leave our name out of it? We write books to make a name for us, don’t we?! We live in a time where people don’t hesitate to steal others’ ideas and publish as their own. But, Thiruvalluvar wrote this incredible book and left his name out of it. Why ?
He didn’t mention his name because he believed that the concepts of Aram, which is what Thirukkural is about, did not belong to him. To take ownership of the book would mean the rules were his original ideas and that would amount to telling a lie. So he leaves his name out of the Masterpiece.  

We have to admire the truthfulness of the poet. We should understand that he was a man who was bound by Aram. Thiruvalluvar did not create these rules of life. His job was merely to observe from nature and record them in writing. He is not the origin of Aram. Aram existed even before Thiruvalluvar wrote about it.  

Let’s take this example: A child runs to play in rain while his mother warns, “if you play in the rain you will catch a fever”. The child does not listen and plays in the rain and catches a fever. Does that mean that he caught a fever because his mother said so? No, he caught a fever because he played in the rain. His mother knew this from her experience and observation. It is not her rule. Whether she observed or not, such a rule always existed in nature.
So, Aram existed in nature, long before Thiruvalluvar wrote about it. He is only an observer and so he did not record his name as the author of his work.

## PARIMELAZHAGAR
When we set out to learn something from a book, we should learn to absorb it from the point of view of the author. We may have many ideas ourselves about the topic, but all of that should be kept aside. We should attempt to see what the author’s viewpoint is.  But, how can we make sure that we are indeed looking at any book from the author’s mindset?    

We should understand the basics of written communication. There are three levels of communication: Words, Meaning, and Emotion (Unarvu).  
Words are used to communicate ideas. When we read (a story book, a newspaper or this blog) we go from the words to the meaning behind them. From the meaning we must move to the feeling/emotion (Unarvu in Tamil).  When we move to the Unarvu all the differences will cease to exist. The following example will help.  

1.At the first level, we exchange ideas through **words**. But this level of communication is not free of differences. For example, the words – Mom, Amma, Momia, Ma all refer to the same thing (that is, Mother). But these words indicate a difference in language.    

2.At the second level of communication we go to the **meaning**. Mom, Momiaa and Ma may differ in language but they all mean the same thing. So at the level of meaning, some differences are eliminated. But still, when we think of Mom, an English speaking woman wearing western clothes come to mind, Amma triggers an image of a south Indian lady wearing a saree, Momia may trigger an image of a Spanish mother. So differences still remain.  

3.At the third level, if we move to the emotion or to the **feeling** of “Motherhood”, that feeling is universal. Be it an American, Indian, Chinese or Spanish, we all feel the same unconditional love when we think of Motherhood. Now, communication is complete. When two people are united at the Unarvu level, there will be no corruption in exchange of ideas.  

So when reading anything, we should look for the **feeling or Unarvu**. That will give the true intention of the author. When drinking coffee from a cup, we drink the coffee and discard the cup. The purpose of the cup is only to serve the coffee. Similarly, once we reach the meaning carried by the words, we can mentally disregard the words. And once we reach the Unarvu from the meaning, we can disregard the meaning.    

About five hundred ago, there was a need for an explanation of Thiruvalluar’s work. Thiruvalluvar was a man of few words. He condensed many great truths in few words. Such a technique of condensing big Truths in few words, is called Soothiram in Tamil. Tamil poetic literature is based on Soothiram. It is a science in itself.  

Imagine if we have to stuff a lot of cotton in a small glass jar. We can adopt many techniques. We may roll them into threads, or small balls and stuff them in the box, pack it tightly and stuff some more and so on. When taking the cotton out, a similar technique must be employed. Only someone who understands how it was stuffed, will be able to successfully extract a small piece of cotton. Others will simply dig, push, punch and eventually break the jar in frustration. Similarly, we need a guru to tell us how to un-stuff the information from Thirukkural.  

So, as time went by, languages also evolved and there was a need to translate Thirukkural. Nature gave us a Guru, saint called **Parimelazhagar**. He was a scholar and was one with Thriuvalluvar at the **Unarvu level**. He wrote a book explaining Thirukkural in conceptual and grammatical detail. Such a book that explains the concepts of another work is called Urai in Tamil. He gives conceptual and grammatical explanations on Thirukkural in his explanatory review, Parimelazhagar’s Urai. This is the book that our Guru Ilangai. Jeyaraj adopted to teach us.  

When you and I read Thirukkural, we will start with the words and search for the meaning from the dictionary. But when Parimelazhagar reads Thirukkural he already knows what the author is trying to say and then he understands why a particular word was used to express that idea. So, his explanation of Thirukkural will be unique because he will explain the unwritten concepts behind the words.   

Umapathy Sivachariar is a well known Shaivite Guru from Chidambaram, who wrote eight out of the fourteen Shaivite Shastras in his book called Siddantha Attagam. (His guru is Maraignana Sambandar, a disciple of Arulnanandi Sivacharya. These are big names in the Shaivite family). He says that a person who has read the following six books is considered an expert in Tamil:  
1) Thirukkural  
2) Thiruvasagam  
3) Tolkappiam  
4) Parimelazhagar’s Urai  
5) Periya Puranam  
6) Sivangana Sithiyar.  

Interestingly, five of them are original books and Parimelazhagar’s Urai is the only Note for a Main Book. So this tells us that reading Parimelazhagar’s Urai will give a knowledge that is equivalent to reading one of the main books.  

Whether we become great scholars in Tamil or not, one thing is certain: **we WILL excel in living our lives when we read Thirukkural.**

*But we should not read it as a lesson. It is essential to capture the Unarvu. Only then the 100% purpose of the book is served. It is not necessary to give importance to the words, or memorize them. Just an understanding of the fundamental idea is enough.*

### How to learn Tamil?
The proper way of way of learning Tamil is this order: 1) Letters or alphabets (Ezhuthukkal) 2) Vocabulary (Nigandu/Agarathi) 3) Grammar (Ilakkanam) and 4) Logic & Reasoning (Tharkam).  

These four are called Instrument Books (or Karuvi Noolgal, in Tamil). A knowledge of these four will enable one with tools to stuff and un-stuff big truths using few words (Grammar and Logic are the two handles for this purpose). Using these tools, anyone can read any Tamil literature with ease.

## VARNASHRAMA DHARMAM
If people decided live a solitary life in an isolated place, without interacting with anyone else, then there is no need for any kind of social structure or rules. But, when two people have decided to co-exist in a place, then both need rules for peaceful existence.
As long as I am restricted to my room, I can keep my legs wherever I want, I can be clothed or not, whatever, it’s my choice. But the minute I invite another person in my room, then both have to follow certain rules. Certain restrictions are necessary to have a peaceful life. We should understand that the restrictions apply to both people and both suffer a loss of individual freedom.  

Similarly, in ancient Tamil society, when people decided to stay as a group there was a need to formulate rules. As a society too, when a rule is made, some where some group of people are losing their independent freedom in favor of the greater good. For eg: Parents lose their freedom in teaching their children. Children pick up what they see. So to impart good values to children parents make many modifications in their behavior. If we are going to fight for the lost individual freedom, the larger group will collapse. In a society we cannot have 100% freedom for all. Chanakya’s Needhi Nool (an ancient book on Political Science) also favors the idea of greater good for the greater number of people. He says that even if an individual somehow succeeds in having his individual freedom he will eventually go down when the society collapses.  

But how can one formulate rules for a diverse group of beings? People differ in terms of intelligence, age and skills. You can imagine the difficulty and complexity of such a task.  How can anyone frame a set of rules that will apply to all? To do that our ancestors understood that they had to divide the people into groups, using some criteria.  

But why divide?  
Let’s take the example of a school. It is not the best way to have a single hall and throw all children in a single class and have a single syllabus for all. It is also impossible to make independent syllabus for each and every student. So we have divided children into groups based on age and/or skills and then create a syllabus for each group.  

Similarly, we can identify groups in the society before framing rules for them. Our ancestors thought about it and observed that society naturally progressed towards a certain kind of classification. They identified and named the classification and formulated rules for each group. Thus was born the first Dharmam (aram or rules) called Varnashrama Dharmam. A Dharmam that we, today’s learned people, have managed to drag to the witness stand with the accusation of being a forerunner of deterioration in a society. We identify it as the root cause of all the evils of caste system and the foundation of destruction of a society.  

Would a society that has been so advanced in their thinking, give the name “Dharmam” to something that would deteriorate them? We should try to answer this using anumana pramanam ? If our ancestors have intentionally named a socially destructive policy as Dharma, then we can safely conclude that they were real fools and there is nothing of value to learn from them. But in all fairness, we have to see why this was created before arriving at such a conclusion. Even if we don’t wholeheartedly accept the idea, it is our duty to at the very least know what got them to form this Dharmam before we analyze with our individual minds.  

The fundamental need for people is food, a basic need for survival. So a group of people with the required skill set came forward to do that task. This group formed the first pillar. They were the **“Producers” (a.k.a Shudran)**. In today’s society, all workers who are involved in manual labor to produce goods would fall in this category. A carpenter, plumber, farmer, factory worker etc.  

But, the society was not complete. Problems arose. Each person produced one or two items and there was confusion in sharing. There was a  need to distribute the goods among people. The producers were not skilled at doing this. So another group of people came forward to do that. That group was the second pillar, the **“Traders” group (a.k.a Vaishyan)**. All current day business people would fall in this category.  

Now, two problems emerged: The stronger person began to exploit the weaker. For eg, one person produced salt and another produced rice. Salt is fundamental to all food, we cannot live without salt but it takes less effort to make it. Rice on the other hand, requires more effort and it had alternatives. So salt manufactures exploited the importance of salt in the diet and they fixed exorbitant prices. Rice manufacturers suffered. Not only is their task difficult, but they could not fix high prices like salt producers, because people can live without rice.  

Additionally, a physically strong person was able to extort things from the less strong sections. For instance, a physically strong man could walk in a grab another’s wife or car. He always won. So now, there was a need for a protector. Someone stronger than the strongest man. Someone to say “hey stop it, you cannot do that”. A King cannot do this job alone. He needs a support group before he can govern the people. That group was called **“Protectors” (a.k.a Kshatriyan)**, the third pillar. That group worked for the benefit of others. In our current society soldiers, judges, lawyers, policemen etc will fall in this category.  

Still problems persisted. The strength of a society lies in its intellectual advancement in all the previous groups. Otherwise economically the nation will be left behind. We all know that. So the last group of people had intellectual strength. They were good at research and advancing other areas. Their job was to make sure all other groups were most advanced in their fields. They worked to make better producers, better traders and better protectors. This group was the **“Educator”(a.k.a Brahmanan)**, the fourth pillar. In our current society, teachers and researchers would fall in this category.  

These four groups are called Varnams in Tamil and they form the four pillars supporting ANY society.   

When an object or person is useful to everyone, it commands more value. Because the protector and educator worked for the benefit of others, they automatically had more value and earned more respect. The people wanted them to have their complete focus on serving others and not be distracted by the problems of the commoners like the cost of pumpkins and the rising price of carrots and other day-to-day things. It is not possible to care about others when your own life needs are not taken care of. So there was a system of others paying for their needs. Hence emerged the system of paying taxes for the Protectors and Dakshina for educators. Since their needs were taken care of, they were able to dedicate their time to serve others.  

These classifications were not meant to be carried forward by birth. That is, a producer’s child could become a protector. A trader’s child could become an educator. This was how, the original structure was framed.  

Whether we name it or not, we have to agree that all countries have the above mentioned four groups.  

Now also there was a confusion in creating rules for people. Any human being has two roles. An individual role and a role in the society. We have seen the four roles a person can have in the society. As an individual person too, he moves from being a baby to a child and then to a teenager to a husband,  a father,  a grandfather, a great grandfather and so on.  

Can we create a single rule for all ages? For eg: There is a 3 year old, a 15 year old, a 25, 55, and 75 year old in the Educator group. Can we frame a rule for educators: don’t take interest in girls. This may apply for a 4 year old boy but what about a 25 year old man? It would be absurd. So a separation based on age was necessary.  

Four stages of life was observed in a person’s life. There was an age to learn – learning age (any trade had to be learnt). Next a person seeks a partner and has a family  - family age, an age to retire  - retirement age and an age to let go of everything and search for higher goals or self actualization goals –age to let go. These four groups are called Ashrams. The names given to each age were **Brahmacharyam (learning age), Grihastam (family age), Vanaprastham (retirement age) and Sanyasam (age to let go)**.  

Now we can create a graph with the Varnams on the X axis and the Ashram on the Y axis. Our ancestors identified 16 groups of people and now they were ready for next task of framing rules for each group.  

The rules for a Producer in the learning age would be different from the rules for an Educator in the same age. The rules for a trader in the family age will be different from his rules for his retirement age.  

It is our human tendency to sully every good intent, whether it is religion or electricity or internet and the Varnashrama Dharma is no exception. Our ancestors identified a natural occurrence in a society and organized it in a framework with the intention of framing rules for peaceful co-existence. We know what we have done with it today.  

Using this classification as a base, later authors wrote Aram (rules) for each group. Parimelazhagar adops the Varnashrama Dharma in explaining Thirkkural.

## 1330 Couplets based on Purudartham  

We can imagine how big, a book that gives instructions on life should be. But, Thirukkural’s instructions total 1330 couplets with seven words per couplet. How is it possible to condense our entire life in one book?  

The contents of the book are organized in line with our daily activities. If we list down ALL the activities we perform in a single day of our life, they will fall into one of the following categories: 1) Aram/ Dharma activities (helping others, keeping ourselves clean etc), 2) Wealth seeking activities, 3) Pleasure seeking activities, 4) Activities towards Self actualization. There cannot be a fourth category. This classification is called Purudartham or Purushartham in Sanskrit.  

Thirukkural has a set of instructions for the first three, in three broad sections called **Paal-s** they are,  
1) **Arathu Paal** -  This section discusses the aram in how a husband and wife can live a happy life and perform good deeds.
2) **Porut Paal** - This section discusses the aram in how a couple can earn money to do those good deeds.
3) **Inbathu Paal** - To keep them motivated, the couple engage in pleasure activities. This section discusses the related arams. 
4) Self Actualization - Valluvar does not have a section for the fourth activity because performing the above three activities in the right way will automatically lead a person to self actualization (more on that later).  

Aram has three components: a) Instructions for right path b) Dispute resolution that will be needed when people slip from the right path (vazhakku in Tamil) c) Remedial actions (punishments, or thandam in Tamil) to put people  back on track. Parts b and c do not instruct people about leading a good life, so Thiruvalluvar ignores them and focuses only on Aram.  

All humans go through four personal stages (Learning age, Family Age, Retirement Age, and Age for Self Actualization) and take up one of the four social roles (producer, trader, protector, and educator). Thirukkural talks about Aram that applies to all four social roles. As for the personal roles, he says that the Learning Age (***Brahmacharyam***) is a preparation for Family life (***Grihastham***). We all get an education to earn money to hopefully have a good family. Similarly, the Retirement age (***Vanaprastham***) is a preparation for Self Actualization (***Sanyasam***). When we retire, we learn to let go of things while we are still in a family life. This will prepare us to let go of other attachments to reach our final destination (Veedu).  

So he combines the instructions for learning age and family age and under the tile **Family Portion (Illarav-iyal)**, and combines instructions for Retirement age and Self Actualization age under a common heading **Self Actualization Portion (Thuravarav-iyal)**.
With that the portion of Arathu-Paal comes to an end. It is followed by Porut-Paal and Inbathu paal.    

It is not possible to eat an entire cake without cutting it into smaller pieces. Similarly, Thirukkural has been subdivided into smaller sections (called Paal, Iyal,  and Athigaram ) and organized in a manner that follows a human’s natural progression in life. The book has three major parts called Paal-s in accordance with Purudartham. Each Paal  is further divided into subsections called **Iyal-s**. Each Iyal is divided into smaller sections called **Athigarams** and each Athigaram has 10 couplets called **Kurals**. Each Kural has 7 words, 4 in the first line and 3 in the second line. Thus, we have a total of 1330 Kurals.  

And that is how, Thiruvalluvar condenses the instructions for our entire life in one book, in 1330 couplets (Kurals).

## TAMIL LANGUAGE
How did language come into existence?  

We now understand that humans are blessed with the sixth sense called Manam and that it helps to record events of our lives in all the births. With all the recordings, the Manam gets overloaded. Humans needed a way to lighten and there was a need to share the recordings. Thankfully nature has designed us such that when we share happy recordings our happiness doubles and when we share negative recordings our grief lessens. So we needed a mechanism to share our recordings. The need for language arose.  

Today we are living in a world where we are all proficient in atleast two languages and are good at verbal and written communication. But think of the earliest man before the invention of language. How must he have communicated his ideas? Maybe by body movements or hand gestures? But that wasn’t enough to communicate ideas. He understood that he could make different sounds and then began the mode of communicating through sounds.  

Early humans wanted to represent sound as a symbol and thus letters were born. The function of the letter is to recall a sound, that’s all. The symbol for a sound is also called as Aksharam. It is not clear who created the Tamil Letter, (the belief is Lord Shiva created the letters and Lord Muruga was the authority on the subject and he later passed it on to Sage Agathiyar and so on). 

In Tamil there are a total of 30 alphabets. 12 are vowels and 18 are consonants. We have one letter called “ak” (ஃ) that is called Ayutha Letter. Letters were also assigned gender. All the vowels were masculine and all the consonants were feminine. “ak” (ஃ) is an Androgynous Letter. The vowels and consonants “mix” and 216 Uyir Mei letters are born (The rules for mixing are called “punarchi” rules. Punarchi literally means “mating”). In all, a total of 247 letters are there in Tamil.

Interestingly the vowels are called Soul letters (Uyir ezhuthukkal), Uyir means soul (or Atma) and the consonants are called Body letters (Mei ezhuthukkal), Mei means body. Why would they name the letters thus? They could have named them Clean and unclean letters or higher and lower letters or something like that. Why is there a reference to soul and body?  

When we refer to a person, Ms. A for example, we refer to both the soul and the body of the person. Without soul, “it” is just a body, and without body “it” is just a ghost! So the name of a person refers to both soul and the body. We can see the body, but we cannot see the soul. We understand the presence of the soul indirectly, that is, because the body is working, we understand that the soul present.  

A good language should be easy to understand. That means the rules have to be clear. The characteristics of a letter were defined as:  

1.   One letter should represent one sound.
Letters were invented to recall a sound. There are no silent letters or capital letters. 

2.   Each letter has a written form and a sound form. The written form may vary over time, but the sound should not change.  

The sound of a letter cannot depend on individual words. If a letter is allowed to take a different sound in a word then such a modification will be observed in all similar words. For eg: the letter “ka” (க), can take the sound “ha” in words like, kaa-ka-m, Naa-ka-m, thaa-ka-m, but this will be a rule that will apply to all similar sounding words. That is, the modification can be stated as a rule like  “ka can take the sound ha when it comes between the nedil uyir-mei letter and mei letter”.

We can contrast this with English, to understand better. Eg: In English, the sound of the letter “u” is different in “but” and “put” or the sound of “o” in “hose”, “dose” and “lose” (Cow/how/low – beard/heard – good/food/blood). We can learn these differences only by practice.  

3.   The time to pronounce a letter was also defined.  

“Mathirai” is a unit of time. It is equal to the time taken to bat the eyelid or the time taken to produce a sound with the middle finger pressed against the thumb and snapped. That unit of time is called one Mathirai.  

Coming to the nature of humans. Our ancestors understood that masculine and feminine traits were found in all humans. We can have a man with more feminine traits and a woman with more masculine traits. Depending on the level of masculinity, men were classified as two types:
 1) Ones with Masculine traits and  
 2) Ones with Less Masculine traits.  

Depending on the level of Femininity, women were classified into three types:
1) Extremely feminine (Mellinam)  
2) High on masculine traits (Vallinam)  
3) Somewhere in the middle (Idaiyinam).   

In Ramayanam, when Sage Viswamitrar takes Raman to the forest he encounters Tataka , a Vallinam lady (Vallinam women are natural warriors), next he introduced him to Ahalya an example of Idaiyinam lady and finally to Sita who is a Mellinam lady who Raman eventually marries.  

This classification was applied to letters too.
Vowels (masculine letters) are of two types. We have 7 letters that have to be sounded for 2 Mathirais (they are called Nedil letters) and 5 letters that have to be sounded for 1 mathirai (they are called kuril letters).  

Consonants (female letters) have to be sounded for half a Mathirai.  Among consonants six are Vallinam, six are Mellinam, and six are Idaiyinam.  

The letter “ak” (ஃ) is an androgynous letter because it sometimes assumes a masculine role and other times a feminine role in different places. It is mostly used in poetry and sometimes is sounded for 1 mathirai (like masculine letters) and sometimes sounded for half mathirai (like a feminine letter).  

Uyir letters and Mei letters “mix” or “join” to form Uyir Mei letters. There are rules for this mixing. Take the following example.  

க் (feminite letter) + அ (masculine letter) = க
ik + a = ka  

Here, க் (ik) has half mathirai,  அ (a) has 1 mathirai but க (ka), the result has only 1 mathirai (Not one and half as expected).
When a body and soul are joined, the body is visible but the soul is hidden. Similarly, the result க (ka) takes on the function (sound and mathirai) of the soul (Uyir)  letter and the appearance of Body (Mei) letter க். And that is why letters were named as Soul letters (Uyir letters) and Body letters (Mei letters).  

One cannot help but wonder, the depth of thought that has gone behind the creation of these letters. It seems almost like the language has a life of its own. 

Now, letters were born, and then letters were formed into words and sentences and so on. In the early days humans took a lot of words to express a simple idea. But as civilization advanced, people became adept at using fewer words to express their ideas. Five sentences were used in the place of ten. It then reduced to one sentence, and then to one word and one letter. A language is said to be advanced, if fewer words are used to express an idea.

Ancestral Tamilians didn’t take pride in inventing long words or creating wordy passages. The maximum length of a word is only seven (Uthratathi, which is a name of a star).  The language went a step further and allowed for one letter words (nee – You; vaa – come; thaa - Give; Po –Go). The language advanced some more -  and said some sounds without any letters could also be used for communication and formed a part of the language. For eg: a group of kids are playing nosily in the living room and the father arrives with his boss. As he enters the house he clears his throat. This sound of the throat clearing cannot be expressed in letters but it communicates a message to the children and they understand that their father needs a quiet place for his guest and clear the living room immediately.  

Language developed further. Language developers said, sometimes even sound is not necessary to communicate. Eyes are enough. For eg:  A group of donation seekers come to a house on a Sunday afternoon asking the husband for money to build  a temple. The man takes his purse out, with the intention of giving Rs.5000, the wife gives a piercing look. He immediately understands her intention and gives out Rs.500! or a more familiar example, where a bunch of college boys are standing by the road and a busload of girls come by, hundreds of eye signals will communicate to each other to identify the pretty girls in the group. No sounds were used, when the minds are united at the Unarvu level just silent glances are sufficient.  

Communication started as hand gestures, later grew to many paragraphs and with the advancement of human mind, finally shrunk to mere glances.

 ### Aruvam, Aru-Uruvam and Uruvam
Broadly speaking, Siddhantam says that God has two states of being. 
1.	Swaroopam
2.	Thadathai  
     a. Aruvam  
     b.	Aru-uruvam  
     c.	Uruvam  
     
The first state is called Swaroopam. This is the truest form, which humans cannot comprehend and hence cannot be described by words. We cannot measure an ocean using a small cup. So it is not possible to describe the Superior Power using our limited language. It is for each of us to experience at the end of our journey. We must first accept the presence of such a power. Whether it is Jesus, or Allah or Nature, it exists, that’s all.  

Then what is the use of such a God who can neither be understood nor be described?  
He has another state of being called Thadathai which humans can describe in their vocabulary. In Thadathai, God comes down in three different forms for humans to understand.  

At the first level God comes down in the formless state for those people who are high on logic and reasoning. They don’t need a form or a shape to understand things. Their brain works differently, they find it comfortable to believe that God is everywhere, and there is no need for a temple or statue that would limit His presence. For them God comes down in the formless state. This state of God is called Aruvam state (Aruva Nilai in Tamil). Such a worship is called Aruvam worship. People on the Yogam Path worship God in the Aruvam state.  
At the second level God comes down in a semi-form state. This is for people for whom it is necessary to have some form, not necessarily a human form, something like the Lingam or a cross – a symbolic representation. This is called the Aru-Uruvam style of worship.  

At the third level, God comes down in a worldly form. This is for people who need a form that they can relate to. Maybe the form of a child that reminds us of innocence and joy, or the form of a cow that is soft and gentle, or the form of a powerful woman to remind of the power beyond us. We need to see that form physically, to believe in it. That kind of worship is called Uruvam worship (Uruvam means ‘form or shape’ in Tamil).   

It is below the first and second level, in terms of closeness to the final swaroopam level, but it is not wrong. People in the [Sariyai and Kiriyai](https://github.com/anbarasu0504/UyarValluvam/blob/master/README.md#sariyai-kiriyai-yogam-gnanam) path tend to worship God in Uruvam and aru-uruvam states.  

In the first kural, Thiruvalluvar mentions that God is everywhere. He didn’t specify any shape or place so he is referring to a formless God.  Parimelazhagar points to us that, this is the first level or the Aruvam level of worship (In the subsequent Kurals the other levels will be introduced). The second Kural mentions the feet of God, hence it is a Uruvam level of worship.

### Sariyai, Kiriyai, Yogam, Gnanam  
People are of different kinds. We see differences even between siblings, husbands and wives, parents and children. For some of us, logic and reasoning are the driving force in life. For some of us, our emotions rule our lives. Is it possible then to have a single way of approaching God?  

Eg: Imagine a school that had only one class, one lesson plan and one teacher for all students. This school admits students from the age of five to ninety all in the same class. How effective will the teaching be?  

Siddhantham didn’t believe it was a good idea, so they put forth a four step approach.  

They said that all worship will have to start with the external worship. It is impossible for someone to just close their eyes and be one with God without prior training in the external worship method. (If someone is able to do that, it means they have had such a training in their previous birth). For many, God is still a distant concept. How to start a relationship with Him? We have to start from simple rituals. It may not mean much initially but when the need arises, the process will allow one to go a little deeper.  

The four stages of worship are (one stage will lead to the next automatically):
1.	External worship Or Sariyai  
2.	External-Internal Worship - Or Kiriyai  
3.	Fully Internal Worship or Yogam and  
4.	Becoming one with the Supreme or Gnanam.  

**Sariyai** refers to external form of worship. The following example will help understand better. In many families we will see the parents tell the children to fold their hands or kneel down and pray. The child will do it automatically without understanding the meaning. Many youngsters are also like this. While going in the bike or cycle when they come across a temple, they will gently bow and give a cursory salute. This is the external form or Sariyai worship. It is a simple bow or a hand gesture. That’s all. It may even be done out of compulsion, nevertheless, Siddhantham allows it. It says, there is nothing wrong with it as it is a necessary first step.  

**Kiriyai** is when the external worship touches an internal meaning. Now imagine that the child grows up, and gets married and is expecting his first child. Now the pregnant wife is in the operation theater and the doctor says that the situation is critical and only one life can be saved. The young husband goes to the church/temple/place of worship and with folded arms and tears in eyes asks God to save both lives. At this instant, the Sariyai worship deepened and went to Kiriyai. The mind which gave a cursory bow to the idol now touches a new meaning behind the idol. where the external worship touches the internal worship.  

[**Yogam:**](https://github.com/anbarasu0504/UyarValluvam#pathanjalis-ashtanga-yoga) At the third level, there is no need for a picture or idol of God. A person can simply sit and close their eyes, and the temple comes to them. Some people can connect to God without going to the temple. This is Yogam.  

As can be seen, these types of worship cater to the differences in people’s mind. So there is no need to look down upon any one method. An analogy: When adding two numbers, a child in first grade will require his fingers to count whereas a child in the tenth grade will give the answer instantly. There is no need to tease each other. The first grade child will eventually come to tenth grade and have the same ease. Similarly, the people in Sariyai will come to Yogam gradually.   

**What is Gnanam ?**  

As we go down the Yogam path, we will reach a stage of **“irandara kalathal” (Together yet separable).**  

In yogam, three entities will be present: (1) The person who is trying to reach God, (2) the method of reaching, (3) God. But in “irandara kalathal” there is only one entity. The person, the method and the object of prayer all become one. How do we understand this?  

Consider this example: There is a man on a cycle and he is carrying a long iron pole over his shoulder. There is another lady walking behind within a safe distance to make sure the pole doesn’t hurt her. An observer is observing this scene from a distance.
Suddenly a car comes in front of the cycle, and the man stops suddenly. The lady bends down suddenly to avoid collision. The observer, who is keenly watching this, also bends down as if it is his neck on the line.  We may have also experienced this behavior in us in our lives:  a vicarious threat and the ensuing sudden movement. What’s happening is, for a brief moment, the observer “becomes” the lady and hence the experience of the lady becomes the experience of the observer. The lady and the observer are separable sure, but they become “together” in that brief moment. This is “irandara kalathal”.   

In Gnanam, a soul becomes “One” with God. God and the soul are still two different entities, but they become one (as in the example mentioned above).  When milk and water are mixed, it looks like one homogenous mixture. But we can still separate the water from milk when we boil the mixture (The water becomes vapour).  

Siddhantam maintains that God and Soul are two separate entities. One doesn’t become the Other. This may be a point of departure from other philosophies. Tamil, Thirukkural, and Philosophy are closely knit. It is necessary to delve into any one Philosophy to understand Thirukkural. Thirukkural also touches on a different Philosophy in a later Chapter.  

But for understanding the Kurals, we need a base and for that purpose we try to touch the surface of Saiva Siddhanta Philosophy  
.
A side note: Saiva Siddhantham goes into further sub-classifications of the Natpathangal as (Unamai & Upaaya Sariyai, Kiriyai etc). In total, they have come up with 32 classifications and they say that many more are still possible because people are of many kind.  

When “irandara kalathal” happens a wisdom dawns. That wisdom is called **“Gnanam”**. This gnanam is the limit of our Intelligence. The last point of Tamil’s intelligence or understanding of creation is “Gnanam”. Once this happens, the God will become visible – we call that **“Mukthi”**.  

Some other schools of thought argue that Yogam can lead to Mukthi directly. But Siddhantham specifies that Yogam leads to Gnanam which then leads to “Mukthi”.  

This will lead one to Veedu.

## Pathanjali’s Ashtanga Yoga
In today’s world we see that Yoga is a separate branch where the teaching primarily starts with asanas. Siddhantam includes Yogam as a step in reaching God (As seen in Saiva Natpathangal). The cure of disease, stress reduction etc are only Avanthara benefits. The core benefit is reaching Mukthi.  

Sage Patanjali gave us something called Yoga Sutras. Yoga means Union. Any activity, eg: playing cricket, requires a step by step approach. Yoga is also like that. Yoga is an eight step process. (No, it does not begin with asanam). The first four steps are only preparatory. The 8 steps are:  

1.	Yamam  
2.	Niayam  
3.	Asanam  
4.	Pranayamam  
5.	Pratyaharam  
6.	Dharanai  
7.	Dhyanam  
8.	Samadhi  

**Yamam** means getting rid of bad habits, and **Niyamam** is adopting good habits. This is in short the Aram (Vithithana seithal, vilakkiyathai ozhithal) as mentioned by Thirukkural. Without this, Yoga must not be touched. Why? Because in the path of Yoga, Ashtama Siddhis (8 powers) will be received (Anima, Mahim,a Lahima etc). These 8 abilities will give a human, super powers. Eg: Lord Hanuman could reduce himself to the size of an atom (anima) and blow Himself up to the size of a mountain (Lahima). One could get the ability to walk through walls. Imagine if such abilities came to the hands of ordinary people not knowledgeable in Aram. What a nightmare the world would be! Yogis will make use of such abilities to help other souls or reduce others’ suffering (not for showcasing their talents.)  

**Asana**: When we sit for meditation, our body should cooperate. For that we need practice. In olden days we used to sit on the floor easily. But in modern times, our lifestyles have changed. Not many can sit in one place without heeding to the ensuing pain. Hence it is necessary to train our body to stay still by practicing the asanas so that the body doesn’t interfere when we try to control the mind.   

**Pranayamam**: This refers to the control of Pranan in the breath. There is a relation between [Three Gunas](https://github.com/anbarasu0504/UyarValluvam/blob/master/%E0%AE%85%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D/001.md#introduction-to-chapter-1---praise-of-god-understanding-the-tri-gunas) and the prana. By effectively controlling the breath, it is possible to get the respective guna.  

**Pratyahara**: Many thoughts will arise in the mind. Some are good and others are bad. If we are able to replace a bad thought with a good one, that’s called Pratyaharam.  

**Dharanai**: The ability to focus on one particular good thought. (Any God is chosen)   

**Dhyanam**: The ability to stay with that particular good thought for a prolonged period of time.  

**Samadhi**: The single thought will lead one to thoughtlessness. This is the state in which we were born (Adhi means beginning).  Getting us to that Adhi state is Samadhi. In this state, the Manam, Bhuddi and Ahangaram are stilled and the pure Chitta remains. In this state, one can easily reach Veedu.
