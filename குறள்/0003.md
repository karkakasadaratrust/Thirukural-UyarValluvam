## ஆங்கில விளக்கம்  

### Transliteration
Malarmisai Aekinaan MaaNati serndhaar  
Nilamisai needuvaazh Vaar  

### Short Explanation 
Roughly translated, this Kural states that,  
God will come hurriedly to reside in the flower of those who worship the feet of God. Such people will also live forever.  

### Detailed Explanation
Adhigarams and Kurals are always stacked in a logical order. They were not randomly bunched or thrown around. In the first Kural the nature of the Supreme Power was explained. In the second Kural, Valluvar explained that the goal of education (book knowledge) was to put us on the path to the Supreme. In the next Kurals Thiruvalluvar introduces the different ways in which we can approach the Supreme Power.  

In Kural #3 he talks about approaching the Almighty with our [manam](https://github.com/anbarasu0504/UyarValluvam/blob/master/%E0%AE%95%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%B1%E0%AE%B3%E0%AF%8D/0003.md#what-is-manam) (mind).


* Live forever?  
How can someone live forever? Obviously it is not possible on this earth. Parimelazhagar explains that we can live forever in Veedu if we learn to think constantly about God.  (the word Nilam in the Kural refers to Veedu and not the Earth).  

In this Kural, our manam (loosely referred to as mind) is compared to a flower for its tenderness. Why ?  
As humans we are blessed with a soft manam at birth. Even among animals that have only five senses, cannibalism is not the norm. However hungry a ferocious tiger is, it doesn’t eat its cubs. When love enters the manam, even a five sensed creature exhibits tenderness. So we understand that humans with their six senses, are more cultured in their behavior and were not meant to harm each other. So this Kural says that God will come and reside in a tender flower which is our manam.  

* In what form?  
He will come in a form that the person desires. If someone thinks that God is in the shape of a pen, then He will come and reside in the shape of a pen in their heart.  
Example:  
In Kamba Ramayanam, Prince Bharathan agreed to wait for fourteen years and to rule as a representative of Lord Raman. He worshipped Raman by placing Raman’s sandals on the throne. Bharathan vowed that if he did not see Raman on the following day when the fourteenth year had fully ended, he would enter the fire once for all. As the 14 years drew to a close, Raman worried that Bharathan might kill himself and so sent Lord Hanuman to meet Bharathan and inform that all went well and Raman would return shortly.  

Some devotees of Lord Ram raised a question that if Bharathan worshipped Raman with all his heart then Raman should have appeared in person, why did he send Hanuman instead ?. Scholars explain that, Bharathan worshipped the Sandals of Raman, so in times of danger Raman sent his Holy Feet (God’s feet are respectfully called as Holy Feet or Thiruvadi). Hanuman was a loyal devotee of Raman and in Vaishnava tradition he is also referred to as Raman’s Holy Feet (Thiruvadi). 

So the point is, the Kural tells us that God will come to reside in our manam, in exactly the form that the devotee worships.  

* When will He come?  
He will come immediately - In a rush and hurry. There is a usage of the word Aeginaan in the Kural. It means “Came”. Normally it would mean “God Came”. Since the past tense is used, readers might misunderstand that God once came quickly, sometime in the past, but will He come now? Parimelazhagar gives a beautiful explanation here.  
In spoken Tamil, there is a usage where past tense is used to refer to the future tense to indicate an added urgency. For eg: Consider this scenario: we agreed to go for a movie with a friend after lunch. The friend is waiting outside our house and honks repeatedly to hurry up. We stuff food in our mouth and in a rush to leave quickly, respond “I am there, am there” (vanthutten, vanthutten). We don’t say “I’m coming”, we say “I’m there” even though we are not already there. We use the past tense to indicate that we are coming in a hurry.  

Similarly, God telling us, “I’m there, I’m there” and He is coming in a hurry to sit in our tender heart!  

* In whose heart?  
God will reside in those hearts that think about Him constantly.

This is the crux of this Kural. The word Serndhaar in Tamil normally means “those who joined.” Parimelazhagar explains that the word Serndhaar in the Kural means thinking constantly. As humans, we think that doing good or bad means actually doing with or hands or our body. But there are three types of doing:  
1.   Doing by way of mind  - we wish for good and bad things for others. This is also doing – (By way of Manam or mind)
2.   Doing by way of words - We use good and bad words towards others – (By way of Vaaku or words)
3.   Doing by way of the body  - This we are familiar as doing good and bad deeds – (By way of Mei or Body).  

We must learn to keep all these three types of our “doings” clean. That is called Tri-karuna-suthi. In our lives, we take a ton of effort to keep our body clean, and some effort to keep our words clean, but we don’t understand the importance of our thoughts because no one can see them. We think it is okay to have ill thoughts in our minds, and smile and speak sweet words. That is of no use. All good things MUST begin at the manam. Otherwise the sweet words and the smile will have no use.
We need to start working on cleaning our minds as well because that is the origin of everything. Thoughts will lead to words and words will lead to action.  

So prayer can also be done in these three ways, praying in the mind, praying in words, and praying using our body. The most powerful prayer is the one using our mind.  

* How is it possible to think about God constantly?  
A student once asked Guru Paramahamsar. A bunch of ladies carrying multiple pots on their heads were walking by. They had pots stacked up on their heads that balanced beautifully without anyone holding them while the ladies chatted away. The Guru pointed to those ladies, and asked, “are these women holding on to their pots?”, the student replied “No”. He took a few pots and placed them on the student’s head. He wasn’t able to balance them. The Guru explained, “the women don’t hold on to the pots. But the pots sit there, while the ladies chat on various other topics. You can also do this with practice”. Once we start involving the power of Almighty in our daily activities, then the mind will learn to catch it automatically. You can perform other routine activities alongside.  

There is one more concept that is told to us repeatedly by many religions. What ever thought is held in the mind at the time when the life departs from the body, the next birth will so continue. So if we have thoughts of becoming a rich person, then we will be born as a rich person in the next birth. But this thought will not come easily whenever we want. We need to constantly practice thinking, only then it will come at the time of our last breath too. Similarly, we cannot forget about God now and hope that we will remember Him during our last breath. It won’t happen that way.  

* Power of our thoughts
To stress further on the power of our thoughts, we need to note what Poet Saint Avvaiyar in her poem Athichudi, says: Aram seya virumbu.
It means “(we must) desire to do Aram”.  

These poets come from a time where words were used sparingly. Like Valluvar, she would not put a word unless it has a purpose. She could have said “Aram Sei” and saved a word. But no, she finds it important to place the word Virumbu (means - to desire). She puts that word because we have to first have a DESIRE to do aram. The words and actions will automatically follow.  

Thoughts are like seeds. We only need to plant a seed in our mind and watch it grow as actions in the world. Thoughts will precede words and will eventually lead in action.  

So by thinking about God’s presence in all our actions in our lives, we will have Him reside in our hearts in any form that we desire. Such a person will live forever in Veedu. That is the meaning of this Kural.  

## Explanations
### What is manam?
We experience life by way of sensations that we receive through our sense organs. Any interaction with the world happens thorough our sense organs.  

Living things can be classified based on the number of ways in which they can receive stimulus from the external world. Broadly, living things have a minimum of one way and a maximum of six ways to experience life.  

Plants have only one way to experience the world, that is, through their sense of touch. They use it to respond to light and find water. We can see plants bend towards the sun and the roots grow towards water. Worms have two senses (touch and taste), head lice has three senses (touch, taste and smell), snakes have four senses (touch, taste, smell, and sight) animals have five senses (touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing).  

What about humans? We also experience the world through five sense organs. Then what is the difference between a human and a cow? The difference is we have a sixth sense called manam (in Tamil). Because of the presence of manam, we are able to think and analyze. However hard we may try,  we cannot make a cow to read Thirukkural and plan its life. Only humans can do that. Some researchers argue that manam is present in animals, but it is not fully developed. Just as how a blind person has eyes but cannot see, animals have a manam which is either non-functional or underdeveloped. Among animals, some have a developed sense of manam that comes a bit close to that of humans and those animals are most suited for domestication - cows and dogs are good examples.  

Manam cannot be seen or touched, but it is there, we see it working in our lives. Such things, whose presence cannot be touched or seen are called Sukuma things, and manam is a sukuma organ. The presence of manam is indicated by the ability to talk and smile. Animals cannot talk or smile. Their communication is limited and cannot be equaled to that of a human. Because of the presence of a well developed manam, humans are called as manithan in Tamil. Interestingly, human babies do not have a well developed manam either. Which is why, in Tamil we refer to babies with the pronoun “it” (it cries, it sleeps) and not “he or she”. He/she will be used when the baby has developed the maturity to talk and smile.
