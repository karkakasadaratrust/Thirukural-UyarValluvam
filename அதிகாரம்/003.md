## ஆங்கில விளக்கம்

## Introduction
There is an order in creation that is embedded in Nature. That order is called “Aram”. In simple terms, we can say that God created Aram and embedded it in nature. The first Adhigaram paid respects to the Higher Power God.  

In order for Aram to persist, we need Rain. Rain is an expression of God. Without rain the entire workings of the world will come to a halt: right from a blade of grass to the mighty ocean and even the Devas cannot function without Rain. The second Adhigaram, talked about the workings of Rain.  

Is it possible to extract the Aram from nature and apply it to Human lives? Who is the right person for that?  
Valluvar says that Neethar or Sages who have fully renounced all materialistic ties have the capabilities to explain to us the hidden order in Nature as it applies to human lives.  

But who are these Sages?  The next Adhigaram explains to us about Neethaar (meaning, “one who as renounced all”).  

Why do we need Neethar? Why can’t we ourselves observe Nature and understand?   
If humans must make their own mistakes in life and learn from scratch, every single time, then there is no use in our race being blessed with six senses. If fire is hot, then it is enough if one human learns it. Others must be able to benefit from that person’s experience.  
Why should we believe Neethar? 
In the FAQ section, there is a question that addresses [Pramaanams](https://github.com/anbarasu0504/UyarValluvam/blob/master/README.md#pramanams). Only Neethars can have Yoga Kaatchi and hence whatever they say is considered as Agama Pramaanam. With this Yoga Kaatchi, many things that is not visible to ordinary humans, will become clear.  

For instance, in Kanda Puranam there is a mention that Soorapadman ruled over many worlds. This is not a fragment of someone’s imagination. Only a Neethaar can see such things.So, ordinary humans do NOT have the capacity to question their words. If one has become a Yogi then one can verify these truths for oneself. Until then, we have to believe the words of the Neethar. Thiruvalluvar and Parimelazhagar are Neethars and they have extracted the Aram from nature and shown us how to apply this to Human lives. We have to simply accept these truths. There is no space for any additional research questioning the truths in their findings. It is better if we refrain from finding fault in their words.  

There is another [Iyal](https://github.com/anbarasu0504/UyarValluvam/blob/master/README.md#1330-couplets-based-on-purudartham) called Thuravara-viyal that also seems to talk about Renunciation. How is that different from this Adhigaram?  
The later section talks about the Aram from a Grihastha who is trying to become a Neethar. This section is all about a person who has succeeded in such a process and has renounced ALL ties.
